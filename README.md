# Description

This Javascript code is the main code that can be used to disapear a strip on Wix Dev Mode. I personally use it to set up loading modules until the background elements has been loaded. 

# Instructions

1) The code should get insrtalled at the main brancj of the website - all pages -, or are the - this page - section to make it work on a specific page. 

2) At this section ('#columnStrip12'), yo need to change the "columnStrip12" to the strip's ID and name at your specific website that you want to get dissapeared once everything has been loaded. NOTE: Please make sure that this code has the correct Strip ID name at each page that is installed, otherwise it won't work.
